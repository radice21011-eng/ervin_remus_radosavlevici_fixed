## About the Project

`ervin_remus_radosavlevici_fixed` is a sophisticated interactive web application designed for comprehensive monitoring, simulation, and strategic management of complex systems, potentially within a celestial or distributed resource context. Leveraging a modern React and TypeScript frontend, this platform offers detailed visualizations, real-time data insights, and advanced control features.

The application integrates various modules, including:

*   **Celestial Data Visualization:** Interactive 3D views, orbital, and star map displays to explore and understand spatial relationships.
*   **Simulation & Time Controls:** Tools to manipulate and observe system behavior over time, allowing for predictive analysis and scenario planning.
*   **Security & AI Overview:** Dedicated dashboards providing insights into system security status and AI-driven analytics, ensuring operational integrity and informed decision-making.
*   **Resource & Capital Management:** Components for tracking and displaying critical resources or financial capital within the system.

This project appears to be a specialized dashboard or control center, providing a fixed and enhanced version of a system designed to manage intricate dynamics, whether they are astronomical, logistical, or abstract system architectures.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive 3D Celestial Viewer:** Explore galaxies, stars, and orbital paths in a dynamic environment.
*   **Detailed Starmap & Orbital Views:** Alternate perspectives for spatial awareness.
*   **Simulation & Time Manipulation Controls:** Adjust simulation speed, advance time, and manage snapshots.
*   **Integrated Security Dashboard:** Monitor key security metrics and threats.
*   **AI Overview & Insights:** Access an AI-driven modal for high-level system analysis.
*   **Dynamic Ranking & Comparison Views:** Analyze and compare system components or entities.
*   **User Authentication System:** Secure access via a login screen.
*   **Configurable Settings Panel:** Customize application behavior and appearance.
*   **Theming (Light/Dark Mode):** Toggle between different UI themes.
*   **Asset Management:** Tools for managing various system assets.
*   **Event Logging & History:** Track system events and activities.
*   **Real-time Capital Display:** Monitor financial or resource capital.
*   **Command Palette:** Quick access to application features.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn.

*   **Node.js**: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm).
*   **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.
*   **yarn** (Optional): `npm install -g yarn`

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL.git
    cd apps/ervinremusradosavlevicifixed
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/ervinremusradosavlevicifixed/` directory based on `.env.local.example` (if provided, otherwise create an empty one or as needed for local development).

Example `.env.local`:
```
VITE_SOME_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   **`npm run dev`** (or `yarn dev`)
    Runs the app in development mode.
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.
    The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

*   **`npm run build`** (or `yarn build`)
    Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

*   **`npm run lint`** (or `yarn lint`)
    Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.

*   **`npm run preview`** (or `yarn preview`)
    Serves the `dist` folder locally for production previewing. This is useful for testing the production build before deployment.
